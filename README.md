Codepath Swift Course Application

Q: How many hours did it take to complete? 
A: Approx 6-8 (corrupted my file and remade it again)

Q: Which required and optional stories have you completed?
A: 
-All of the required stories, e.g. being able to add the bill, managing the numbe keyboard, toggling between calculating a 18, 20, or 22% tip. 
-From the optional stories:
-Added app icons and loading screens
-Added custom text styles and colored background elements
-Added the ability to divide the total bill amongst up to 5 people

Notes:
-I'd like to do more with animation and wasn't able to get the launch screen to work properly, but might submit those later.
